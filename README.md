# Noblist
*Noblist* is basically a *URL parser and editor*.
It stores compressed lists in the URL so it doesn't need any backend. *(The only storage needed is for the URL itself)*
I use it to share list of movies, links, etc. by messenger conversations and bookmarks.

### Todo
- Edit item
- Error handling
- Compression
- Undo / redo
- Better side reload
- Fix CSS
- Item copy button
- Rearranging items
